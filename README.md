## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Docker Desktop** installed on your system (recommended) OR **Python 3.7+** for local setup
2. **A Fitbit account** with a compatible device
3. **A Fitbit Developer App** (you'll create this in Step 1)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Option A: Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed on your system
- A Fitbit Developer App (see Step 1 below)

**Quick Start with Docker:**

1. **Create a Fitbit Developer App:**
   - Go to [https://www.fitbit.com/dev](https://www.fitbit.com/dev)
   - Sign in with your Fitbit account
   - Click **"Register an App"**
   - Fill in the required information:
     - **Application Name**: `FitBaus` (or any name you prefer)
     - **Application Type**: `Personal`
     - **OAuth 2.0 Application Type**: `Client`
     - **Redirect URL**: `http://localhost:8080/callback`
     - **Default Access Type**: `Read-Only`
   - Click **"Register"**
   - **Important**: Copy and save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you'll need these in the next step

2. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fitbaus
   ```

3. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   **Note**: This will start the web server automatically. You'll need to open a **new terminal window/tab** for the next step.

4. **Access the container** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   docker exec -it fitbaus-app bash
   ```
   You should now see a prompt like: `root@cf3bf4c0e3e0:/app#`

5. **Create a profile and authenticate:**
   ```bash
   # Create a profile (replace 'myprofile' with your desired name)
   python auth/authorize_fitbit.py --profile myprofile
   ```
   
   **Alternative - Run without parameters for guidance:**
   ```bash
   # Run without parameters to see usage guidance and options
   python auth/authorize_fitbit.py
   ```
   This will show you the correct syntax and offer to continue with a "default" profile for single-user setups.
   
   **Note**: In Docker, the browser won't open automatically. You'll see instructions like:
   ```
   Opening browser for Fitbit login...
   
   Instructions:
   1. Complete the login process in your browser
   2. You'll be redirected to a URL that looks like:
      https://localhost:8080/callback?code=XXXXX
   3. Copy the ENTIRE redirected URL and paste it below
   ```
   
   **What to do:**
   1. **Look for the authorization URL** in the terminal output (it will be displayed after "Opening browser for Fitbit login...")
   2. **Copy and paste** that URL into your browser's address bar
   3. **Complete** the login and authorization process
   4. **Important**: The Fitbit page will ask you to approve permissions for:
      - Sleep data
      - Heart rate data  
      - Activity and exercise data
      - Profile information
   **Make sure to click "Allow All" to grant all permissions**
   5. **Copy the entire redirected URL** from your browser's address bar (including `?code=XXXXX`)
   6. **Paste it** back into the terminal when prompted

6. **Fetch your data:**
   ```bash
   # Fetch data for your profile
   python fetch/fetch_all.py --profile myprofile
   ```
   
   **Note**: The fetch process may take several minutes and will show progress indicators. You'll see:
   - `[1/4] Starting fetch_steps.py...`
   - `[2/4] Starting fetch_rhr_data.py...`
   - `[3/4] Starting fetch_hrv_data.py...`
   - `[4/4] Starting fetch_sleep_data.py...`
   
   Each script will fetch data from your Fitbit account and save it to CSV files.

7. **Access the dashboard:**
   - Open http://localhost:9000 in your browser
   - Your data will be persisted in the `profiles/myprofile/csv/` directory

**Troubleshooting**: If you see your local machine's data instead of the Docker container's data, try:
   - Check if you have a local web server running on port 8080: `netstat -an | findstr :8080`
   - Verify the container is serving the right content: `docker exec -it fitbaus-app curl http://localhost:9000`
   - Check what's actually running in the container: `docker exec -it fitbaus-app ps aux`
   - Verify the web server is running: `docker exec -it fitbaus-app netstat -tlnp | grep :9000`

**Docker Benefits:**
- ✅ **Isolated environment** - no Python version conflicts
- ✅ **Easy deployment** - works on any system with Docker
- ✅ **Data persistence** - your data survives container restarts
- ✅ **Consistent setup** - same environment for everyone

### Option B: Local Python Setup

### Step 1: Create a Fitbit Developer App

1. Go to [https://www.fitbit.com/dev](https://www.fitbit.com/dev)
2. Sign in with your Fitbit account
3. Click **"Register an App"**
4. Fill in the required information:
   - **Application Name**: `FitBaus` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Application Type**: `Personal`
   - **OAuth 2.0 Application Type**: `Client`
   - **Redirect URL**: `http://localhost:8080/callback`
   - **Default Access Type**: `Read-Only`
5. Click **"Register"**
6. **Important**: Copy and save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you'll need these in the next step

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests pandas
```

### Step 3: Create a Profile and Authenticate

**Create a profile** (this organizes your data and tokens):

```bash
# Create a profile (replace 'myprofile' with your desired name)
python auth/authorize_fitbit.py --profile myprofile
```

**Alternative - Run without parameters for guidance:**
```bash
# Run without parameters to see usage guidance and options
python auth/authorize_fitbit.py
```
This will show you the correct syntax and offer to continue with a "default" profile for single-user setups.

**What happens during authentication:**
1. The script will prompt you for your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Step 1
2. Your browser will open to Fitbit's authorization page
3. Log in with your Fitbit credentials and authorize the app
4. **Important**: The Fitbit page will ask you to approve permissions for:
   - Sleep data
   - Heart rate data  
   - Activity and exercise data
   - Profile information
   **Make sure to click "Allow All" to grant all permissions**
5. You'll be automatically redirected back to the application
6. The script will save your access tokens to `profiles/myprofile/auth/tokens.json`

**Note**: The first time you run this, you'll need to enter your credentials. They'll be saved for future use.

### Step 4: Fetch Your Data

Once authenticated, fetch your Fitbit data for your profile:

```bash
# Fetch data for your specific profile
python fetch/fetch_all.py --profile myprofile
```

This will download:
- **Steps data** (daily step counts)
- **Sleep data** (sleep scores, minutes asleep, sleep stages)
- **Heart Rate data** (HRV and resting heart rate)

**Data Storage**: Your data is saved as CSV files in the `profiles/myprofile/csv/` directory (profile-scoped storage).

### Step 5: Launch the Dashboard

**Start the Flask web server** (required for loading CSV files and API functionality):

```bash
# Start the Flask server
python server.py
```

**Access the dashboard:**
- Open http://localhost:9000 in your web browser
- The dashboard will load your Fitbit data from the CSV files

**Note**: The default server port is 9000 (both locally and in Docker). You can change it by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

**Note**: You cannot simply open `index.html` directly in your browser because the JavaScript needs to fetch CSV files, which requires a web server due to browser security restrictions.

## 🔄 Daily Usage

### Restarting the Container (Without Losing Data)

If you need to restart the container, your data will be preserved:

```bash
# Stop the container
docker-compose down

# Start it again (your data is preserved)
docker-compose up
```

**If you made changes to docker-compose.yml or Dockerfile**, you need to rebuild:

```bash
# Stop the container
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start (your data is still preserved)
docker-compose up --build
```

**Your data is safe** because it's stored in the `csv/` and `profiles/` directories on your host machine, which are mounted into the container.

### Refreshing Data

#### **Web Interface (Recommended)**
The easiest way to refresh your data is using the web interface:

1. **Open the dashboard** at http://localhost:9000
2. **Select your profile** from the dropdown
3. **Click the reload icon (🔄)** to the left of the profile dropdown
4. **Wait for completion** - the interface will show real-time progress
5. **Data automatically refreshes** when the fetch completes

#### **Command Line (Alternative)**
You can also fetch data manually via command line:

```bash
# Access the container
docker exec -it fitbaus-app bash

# Fetch new data
python fetch/fetch_all.py --profile myprofile
```

### Multi-Profile Support

**Profile Management** is a key feature that allows you to manage multiple Fitbit accounts or different time periods:

#### **Creating Profiles:**
```bash
# Create a new profile (replace 'profile_name' with your desired name)
python auth/authorize_fitbit.py --profile "profile_name"
```

#### **Profile CLI Options:**
```bash
# Fetch data for a specific profile
python fetch/fetch_all.py --profile "profile_name"

# Fetch data for multiple specific profiles
python fetch/fetch_all.py --profiles "profile1" "profile2" "profile3"

# Fetch data for ALL discovered profiles
python fetch/fetch_all.py --all-profiles

# Use environment variable for default profile
export FITBIT_PROFILE="myprofile"
python fetch/fetch_all.py  # Uses the environment variable
```

#### **Profile Structure:**
Each profile creates its own directory structure:
```
profiles/
├── myprofile/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── tokens.json          # Your access tokens
│   │   └── client.json          # Your app credentials
│   └── csv/                     # Your data files
│       ├── fitbit_activity.csv
│       ├── fitbit_sleep.csv
│       ├── fitbit_hrv.csv
│       └── fitbit_rhr.csv
└── another_profile/
    ├── auth/
    └── csv/
```

**Legacy Mode (Default Profile):**
If you use the "default" profile mode, data is stored in:
```
profiles/
└── default/
    ├── auth/
    └── csv/
```

#### **Profile Benefits:**
- ✅ **Multiple accounts** - manage family members' Fitbit data
- ✅ **Data isolation** - each profile has separate data and tokens
- ✅ **Easy switching** - use different profiles for different time periods
- ✅ **Backup friendly** - each profile is self-contained

### Data Management

#### **Resetting Application Data:**
If you need to start fresh or clean up your data:

```bash
# Reset all user data and return to clean state
python reset.py
```

**What gets reset:**
- All profile data (tokens, credentials, CSV files)
- All user-generated content
- Returns application to initial state

**What's preserved:**
- Application code and configuration files
- Docker setup and requirements

**Safety features:**
- Confirmation prompt before deletion
- Clear warning about data loss
- Usage instructions when run without parameters

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Problems:**
- Ensure your redirect URL in the Fitbit app matches exactly: `https://localhost:8080/callback`
- Check that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Make sure you've authorized the app in your Fitbit account
- If authorizing secondary user, the authorization script may have to be run a second time for it to succeed. 

**Data Fetching Issues:**
- Verify your Fitbit device has synced recent data
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure your access tokens haven't expired (run authentication again if needed)

**Dashboard Not Loading:**
- Make sure you've fetched data first using `fetch_all.py`
- Check that CSV files exist in the `profiles/[profile_name]/csv/` directory
- Verify the correct profile is selected in the dropdown
- Try refreshing your browser

**Profile Management Issues:**
- If you can't see your profile data, check the profile dropdown in the UI
- Ensure you're using the same profile name for authentication and data fetching
- Use `python auth/authorize_fitbit.py --sync-profiles` to refresh the profile list
- Check that profile directories exist in the `profiles/` folder

**Data Reset Issues:**
- Use `python reset.py` to clean up all user data and start fresh

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Data**: All your data is stored locally on your computer
- **No Cloud Storage**: Your Fitbit data never leaves your device
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure API access
- **Token Management**: Access tokens are stored securely and can be refreshed automatically

## 📈 Data Retention & API Limits

- **Historical Data Access**: The Fitbit API provides access to your historical data without strict time limitations (varies by data type and device)
- **Rate Limiting**: 150 API requests per hour per user 
- **Rate Limit Headers**: The API includes helpful headers to monitor usage:
  - `Fitbit-Rate-Limit-Limit`: Total requests allowed per hour
  - `Fitbit-Rate-Limit-Remaining`: Requests remaining before hitting the limit
  - `Fitbit-Rate-Limit-Reset`: Seconds until the limit resets
- **Automatic backoff (what you’ll see during fetches)**:
  - The fetch scripts automatically respect Fitbit’s rate-limit headers. When the headers indicate you’re at the limit, the scripts pause and show a live countdown (mm:ss), then resume.
  - On HTTP 429 responses, the scripts wait for the header-provided reset time if present; otherwise they wait until the next top of the hour (plus a small buffer) before retrying.
  - Even when a request succeeds, the scripts may still throttle briefly if the response headers suggest a reset is imminent. This avoids hitting the limit on subsequent requests.
  - Token refresh requests also use exponential backoff and honor `Retry-After` if provided.
  - Seeing “Retrying in mm:ss” or “Waiting until HH:00:SS” is expected behavior, not a hang.
- **Data Backup**: Consider backing up your `csv/` directory to preserve your data
- **Regular Fetching**: Run fetch scripts regularly to build up your historical dataset

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

1. **Regular Data Fetching**: Run `fetch_all.py` daily or weekly to maintain a complete dataset
2. **Consistent Wear**: Wear your Fitbit device consistently for accurate data
3. **Sync Regularly**: Ensure your Fitbit device syncs with the app regularly
4. **Profile Management**: Use different profiles for different family members or time periods

## Self-Hosting with Docker (Quick Guide)

The repository includes a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for running FitBaus locally on your server.

- Build and run
  - `docker compose up -d` (serves the UI on http://localhost:9000)
  - Data persists in `./profiles` (tokens, per‑profile data) and `./csv`.

- Authorize a profile
  - Open the app (http://localhost:9000) → Profile Management → Create a profile.
  - Use the built‑in authorization flow. Manual mode works everywhere (open URL, paste code). Background capture is optional (see below).

- Fetch and explore
  - Press ↻ to fetch data, then switch charts and ranges.

- Container health & user
  - The image runs as a non‑root `app` user.
  - A Docker `HEALTHCHECK` hits `/api/health` for status.

- Optional background OAuth
  - Requires a local HTTPS redirect such as `https://localhost:8080/callback`.
  - In compose, uncomment `8080:8080` and set `FITBIT_REDIRECT_URI`, `FITBIT_SSL_CERT`, `FITBIT_SSL_KEY`; mount your `./certs` directory accordingly.

- Production Deployment
  - The Docker image uses Gunicorn WSGI server (not Flask dev server) for production.
  - Configured with 2 workers, proper timeouts, and request limits for stability.
  - Uses UTC timezone by default; set `TZ` environment variable to match your timezone.
  - Health check endpoint available at `/api/health` for monitoring.
  - For high-traffic deployments, consider using a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) with load balancing.

- Security
  - Do not expose the service directly to the internet without a reverse proxy and authentication.
  - Recommended: Proxy with HTTPS (Caddy/Traefik/Nginx) and basic auth or IP allowlisting.
  - Tokens are stored in `profiles/<id>/auth/tokens.json`; keep this directory private and backed up.
